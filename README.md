1. Assignment 1 - Object Detection using HoG feature extraction to detect pedestrians from a continous video fraame.
2. Assignment 2 - State estimation of detected object and provide a track reprsentation of multiple moving objects using Bayesian Filtering.
3. Assignment 3 - Finally motion planning methods are implemented using A* path finding algorithm to avoid obstacle and assist parking.
