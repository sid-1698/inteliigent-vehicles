# Intelligent Vehicles

### This source code is divided into 3 sections which form the crux of any intelligent vehicle. 
1. Object Detection - Object Detection is implemented using HoG feature vectors to detect pedestrians from a live video feed.
2. State Estimation - Object detection is combined from moving targets and preprocessed using Bayesian (Kalman) filtering to estimate state and detect the location of vehicle in the space.
3. Motion Planning - Motion planning of vehicle is optimized using A* path finding algorithm to provide the best route and assist in parking. Obstacle avoidance is also designed to steer the vehicle from any potential danger.
